# Topic: DeepLineDP: Towards a Deep Learning Approach for Line-Level Defect Prediction

## Approach towards extending the original repository
Original repository for research paper was separated into two:
- supplementary materials (scripts for training models) - 
the original from [awsm-research/DeepLineDP](https://github.com/awsm-research/DeepLineDP) 
was pasted into [DeepLineDP](/DeepLineDP) folder.
- database - original from [awsm-research/line-level-defect-prediction](https://github.com/awsm-research/line-level-defect-prediction)
was pasted into [DeepLineDP/datasets](/DeepLineDP/datasets) folder.

We decided to merge two repositories in order to make reproduction easier.
